1) What is the flush interval command line option?
  The ```flushInterval``` parameter allows you to customize the interval at which logs are fetched. By default it fetches at a 24-hour interval.

2) How Access Log collection works?
   By default,  SlackLogsIntegration fetches team access logs within the last 'flushInterval' duration. The default value for 'flushInterval' is 24 hours.

3) Is there any database used in between?
   No. It retrives logs from the Slack API and forwards to New Relic.
