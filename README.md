# Slack Logs to New Relic Log API
Send following Slack API logs to New Relic's Log API. ðŸš§ This project is currently work in progress and supports following logs collection
- [ChannelDetail](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list)
- [UserLogs](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list)
- [AccessLogs](https://api.slack.com/methods/team.accessLogs)
- [ConversationLogs](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history)
- [AuditLogs](https://api.slack.com/admins/audit-logs) 

### Prerequisites
- Install Slack app with required permissions and collect user token. Use this token as a SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN system variable. Currently, SlackLogsIntegration requires following permissions.<br>
      ```admin, users:read, channels:read, teams:read, channels:history, auditlogs:read ```

  Please [refer Development](#Development) if you need help to create a Slack app.
- Get New Relic ingest key. Use this key as a INGEST_KEY system variable.

### Installation
Slack logs integration can be installed in two ways

#### Option 1: Docker Container
- Build docker image using [Dockerfile](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/SlackLogsIntegration/blob/main/Dockerfile)
  ( `docker build --no-cache --tag slack-logger .` )  
- Refer [Configuration](#configuration) for available config options
- Start the application in side the container, with required params
```bash
docker run -e SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> -e INGEST_KEY=<key> slack-logger
```
#### Option 2: Standalone binary
- Build binary from the source code
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/SlackLogsIntegration.git
  cd SlackLogsIntegration
  GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -o /slackLogger internal/main.go
```
- Refer [Configuration](#configuration) for available config options
- ` export SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> `
- ` export INGEST_KEY=<key> `
- Start application directly on host
```bash
  /slackLogger
```

### Configuration
Configuration ```SlackConfig.yaml``` with defaults is self-describing for this application:
```bash
global:
  flushLogSize: 1MB
  logAPIEndPoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1
  logLevel: info

conversationLogs:
  enabled: True
  pollingInterval: 5m

channelDetails:
  enabled: True
  pollingInterval: 6h

userLogs:
  enabled: True
  pollingInterval: 24m

accessLogs:
  enabled: True
  pollingInterval: 5m

auditLogs:
  enabled: True
  pollingInterval: 5m
```

### Browse your Log data in NR
- [Login into One New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com)
- Open `Query Your Data` ![Alt text](./images/nr1-step-1.png)
- Query the data using NRQL ![Alt text](./images/nr1-step-2.png) 
  - select * from Log  where logtype='ChannelDetail' since 1 day ago

## Troubleshooting
- Please check whether Slack app has installed with proper permissions.
- Audit logs can be collected only using organisation wide access token
- Please refer FAQ[https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/SlackLogsIntegration/blob/update-readme/FAQ.txt]

## Development
- [Create a new Slack APP](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart)
- [Slack App home page](https://api.slack.com/apps)
- [Create a new Slack APP on Enterprise grid](https://api.slack.com/enterprise/grid)
- [Slack access token authentication](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2)
- Verify token validay by triggering respective [API call](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list/test)
