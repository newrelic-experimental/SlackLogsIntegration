# Slack Logs to New Relic Log API
Send follwoing Slack API logs to New Relic's Log API. ðŸš§ This project is currently work in progress and supprots following logs collection
- [ChannelDetail](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list)
- [UserLogs](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list)
- [AccessLogs](https://slack.com/api/team.accessLogs)

## Installation
Slack logs integration can be installed in two ways
### Prerequisites
- Install slack APP with required permissions and collect user token. Current solution requires following permissions.<br> 
  admin, users:read, channels:read, teams:read
  
  Please refer [Development](#Development) if you need help to create a slack app

### Option 1: Docker Container

#### Step 1: Install the app and get it ready to run
[//]: # (TODO create GitHub Releases)
- Build the Docker image  ( `docker build  --tag slack-logger .` ) using this `Dockerfile`
```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Step 1: Build the application from source
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS build-stage

WORKDIR /build

# The Go image does not include git, add it to Alpine
RUN apk add git

RUN git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/SlackLogsIntegration.git

WORKDIR SlackLogsIntegration

# Install the application's Go dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Build the executable
RUN GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -o /slackLogger internal/main.go

# Step 2: Deploy the application binary into a lean image
FROM alpine AS build-release-stage

WORKDIR /

COPY --from=build-stage /slackLogger /slackLogger

ENTRYPOINT ["/slackLogger" ]
```

- Prepare, but DO NOT run, the application to run as a detached process that can survive user logout. How to do this is beyond the scope of this document, here is the reference for Docker:
  - [Docker on Linux](https://linux.how2shout.com/how-to-start-docker-container-automatically-on-boot-in-linux/)


#### Step 2: Configuration
Configuration with defaults is self-describing for this application:
```bash
Usage of /slackLogger:
  -NRAccountId string
    	If set, sends logs to New Relic (default "xyz1234")
  -NREndpoint string
    	New Relic log endpoint (default "https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1")
  -accessLogs
    	Fetch access logs
  -channelDetails
    	Fetch channel details
  -flushInterval int
    	Flush interval (default 1440)
  -logLevel string
    	Golang slog log level: debug | info | warn | error (default "info")
  -userLogs
    	Fetch user logs
```

Configuration begins with command line arguments, which may then be overridden with environment variables.
Following command works

```bash
/slackLogger -NRAccountId=<xyz4> -NREndpoint=https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 -logLevel=debug -channelDetails -userLogs -accessLogs
```

#### Step 4: Finish configuring the app and start it
- Start the application, with required params
```bash
docker run -e SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<SlackToken> slack-logger -NRAccountId=<xyz4> -NREndpoint=https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 
 -logLevel=info -userLogs -channelDetails -accessLogs
```
#### Step 5: Go to New Relic and marvel at your Log data
- [Login into One New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com)
- Open `Query Your Data` ![Alt text](./images/nr1-step-1.png)
- Query the data using NRQL ![Alt text](./images/nr1-step-2.png) 
  - select * from Log  where logtype='ChannelDetail' since 1 day ago
 
### Option 2: Standalone binary Installation

```bash
- git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/SlackLogsIntegration.git
- cd SlackLogsIntegration
- go mod download
- GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -o /slackLogger internal/main.go
- export SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN
- /slackLogger -NRAccountId=<xyz4> -NREndpoint=https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 -logLevel=debug -channelDetails -userLogs -accessLogs
```
- Prepare, but DO NOT run, the application to run as a detached process that can survive user logout. How to do this is beyond the scope of this document, here is the reference for systemd service in Linux:

## Troubleshooting

### Slack API key permissions
   Please check whether Slack app has installed with proper permissions 

## Development
- [Create new slack APP](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart)
- [Slack access token authentication](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2)
- Verify token validay by triggering respective [API call](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list/test)
